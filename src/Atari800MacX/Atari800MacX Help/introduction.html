Welcome to Atari800MacX&nbsp;, the Atari 800/XL/XE/5200 emulator
for Macintosh OSX. &nbsp;This quick guide is intended to help those
who are new to Atari Emulation get started quickly. &nbsp;Experience
emulator users should also give this section a quick read to help you
get familiar with some of the special features of the Mac version, and new features of this release, 4.0.<br>



<h1>Donationware</h1>



The emulator is released under the GPL license, however many
months/years of work have gone into it. &nbsp;If you use and appreciate
the emulator, please donate to it's development. &nbsp;You can do this
by clicking on the menu item Donation... under the Atari800MacX menu, or by <a href="http://order.kagi.com/?6FBTU&amp;lang=en">using this link</a>.
<h1>OS ROMS</h1>





The emulator requires that you have ROM images for the Atari operating
system and the BASIC language ROM. &nbsp;These files are not
provided with the emulator for legal reasons, but they are widely
available on the internet. &nbsp;The default names for the ROMS
are&nbsp;atariosa.rom, atariosb.rom,
atarixl.rom,
ataribas.rom, and a5200.rom. &nbsp;By default, the emulator expects
the ROM&nbsp;files to be found in the OSRoms folder in the
Atari800MacX
folder. &nbsp;You can select files with different names or in different locations by using the <a href="RomsTab.html">Roms Tab</a> of the Preferences&nbsp;window.<br>




<h1>Starting the Emulator</h1>




Once the emulator is started, with the ROM files properly installed,
you should see a Blue Screen with white letters in the emulator with
the Atari BASIC ready prompt.<br>




<br>




The first thing you will probably want to do is adjust the display to
your liking. &nbsp;There are many options for the Display
characteristics some of which can be accessed from the <a href="DisplayMenu.html">Display Menu</a>, and others which are available from the <a href="DisplayTab.html">Display Tab</a> of the Preferences window. &nbsp;While we are on the topic, please take time to read through all of the documentation on the <a href="preferences.html">Preferences window</a>.
&nbsp;You can open the Preferences window from the Preferences menu
item in the Atari800MacX menu, or by pressing the command and comma
keys. &nbsp;There are many, many options available in this emulator,
and almost everything you can think of can be customized.<br>




<br>



OK, now you have the emulator up and running, you probably would like
to do something besides seeing the BASIC READY prompt, correct?
&nbsp;The emulator is capable of supporting Atari programs on
cartridge, disk, and cassette image files. &nbsp;To use these files,
you can open them by the menu items in the <a href="MediaMenu.html">Media Menu</a>, or through the controls in the <a href="MediaStatus.html">Media Status</a>
Window. &nbsp;You can also drag and drop the files onto the main
emulator window, although if it is a disk image, it will always be put
in drive 1. &nbsp;For a full list of the file types and extensions
supported by the emulator, please see <a href="FileTypes.html">File Types</a>. <br>



<br>



Finally, I suspect that you would like to simulate the controllers you
used to play those great Atari games. &nbsp;The emulator allows you to
use the keyboard, mouse, and USB gamepads/joysticks to do this.
&nbsp;To find out all of the details, please see the <a href="ControllersTab.html">Controllers</a> and <a href="GamepadsTab.html">Gamepads</a> Tabs in the Preferences window.<br>



<h1>What happens if the&nbsp;Emulated Atari crashes?</h1>

If the emulated Atari crashes, due to an illegal instruction, etc., the
emulator will display an Unrecoverable Error dialog. &nbsp;This
normally happens because of a corrupt disk or cartridge image, or one
that is used incorrectly. &nbsp;(It could happen if your OS ROM images
are bad also). &nbsp;Instead of locking up, the way a real Atari would,
the emulator gives you a choice or removing the media, performing a
warm or cold reset, entering the debug monitor, or simply quiting the
emulator. &nbsp;The Unrecoverable Error Dialog is show below, in both
the Windowed and Fullscreen versions.<br>

<h1>What's New in 4.0?</h1>




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Features Added/Changed:<br>




<ul>



  <li>Added support of VAPI copy-protected disk images. &nbsp;This
does not yet enable&nbsp;all images, but perhaps 90%. &nbsp;If the VAPI dll
source is ever released, this&nbsp;number may be increased. &nbsp;The current
images from www.atarimania.com which are known not to work are:</li><ul><li>Alternate Reality: The City</li><li>Ankh</li><li>Attack at EP CYG 4</li><li>Ballblazer Activision (UK)</li><li>Jenny of the Prairie</li><li>Mercenary - Escape from Targ _ Novagen Software</li><li>Mr. Do!</li><li>Music Studio (The)</li><li>Promoteur</li><li>Rescue on Fractalus! _ Activision (UK)</li><li>Spy vs Spy</li><li>Targets - A Number Game</li></ul><li>Added new D: patch, which provides an alternative to the H: hard drive
emualtion. &nbsp;This sets up D5:-D8: to access hard drive directories one
and two, with or without line feed translation. &nbsp;This allows the
Macintosh hard drive direcories to be accessed by programs which do not
recognize the H: device fully, such as MyDos and Action!.</li>



  <li>Added
multiple preference configurations, allowing you to set up multiple
machine&nbsp;configurations, and load them by opening a .a8c file.</li>



  
  
  
  <ul></ul>



  <li>Added
ability to paste text from the Macintosh to the Atari. &nbsp;The pasted
text&nbsp;is input as keystrokes to the emulator, and should be usable
in most programs.</li>



  <li>Added
ability to copy text from the Atari to the Macintosh.&nbsp; The copied
text can be selected using Select All, or by using the Mouse to define
a selection rectangle on the screen.&nbsp; It works in normal video or
XEP80 modes, but is not available in full screen mode, or if the Mouse
is being used for Mouse Controller emulation.</li><li>Added emulation
of Atari 1200XL Function keys.&nbsp; You can press the Atari F1 by
pressing Option-F1 in the emulator, along with optionally shift and or
control.&nbsp; F2-F4 work the same way.</li><li>Added alternatives for
the Atari keys mapped to the Macintosh&nbsp;
Insert/Delete/Home/End/PageUp/PageDown keys as those keys are not
present on&nbsp; some new Macintosh keyboards.</li><li>Added ability to use multiple analog joysticks on the same gamepad as multiple Atari joysticks.</li>



  <li>Added the following features from version 2.1 of Atari800 Core Emulator</li>



  
  
  
  <ul>



    <li>Added Axlon and Mosaic RAM expansions for Atari 400/800</li>



    <li>Added emulation of MIO and Black Box</li>



    <li>Added support of .PRO copy-protected disk images</li><li>Implemented tape loading with variable bitrates</li><li>Implemented cassette writing via hardware registers</li><li>Added emulation of CX85 numeric keyboard</li><li>R: device can be serial-only or network-only (selectable)</li>



  
  
  
  </ul></ul>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bugs Fixed<ul><li>Fixed caps lock with International Key Mapping on.</li><li>Fixed a bug with turning joystick emulation on and off which was causing a&nbsp;stuck joystick.</li><li>Fixed a bug where one analog joystick was not selectable on Gamepad 2.</li><li>The following fixes were added from version 2.10 of Atari800:</li><ul><li>Fix for "Ilusia" demo</li><li>Better GTIA bug mode emulation</li><li>Fixed POKEY registers: ALLPOT, IRQEN and STIMER</li><li>Various Atari5200 fixes</li><li>Fixed Atrax cartridge bank switching</li><li>Major source code cleanup, compiles with -pedantic etc.</li></ul>



</ul>
