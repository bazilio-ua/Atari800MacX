This tab allows you to set the directories used by the emulator for the
Hard Disk Device Emulator, H: , and for the newly added (version 4.0
and later) D: patch emulator, which uses some of the same directories
used for H:.<br>

<br>

<img src="HardDriveTab.jpg" title="" alt="" style="width: 753px; height: 514px;"><br>

<br>

There are four directories, and they
are mapped to devices as follows:<br>

<br>

<ul>

  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;H0: &#8211; program directory, no conversion</li>

  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;H1: - H4: &#8211; directories #1-#4, no conversion</li>

  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;H5: &#8211; program directory, text conversion
applied</li>

  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;H6: - H9: &#8211; directories #1-#4, text conversion
applied</li>

</ul>The D: patch used D5-D8 as Hard Disk drives, which use the same
directories as some of the H: devices. &nbsp;The mapping is as follows:<br><ul><li>&nbsp;&nbsp; D5 - directory #1, no conversion</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp;D6 - directory #2, no conversion</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp;D7 - directory #1, text conversion applied</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp;D8 - directory #2, text conversion applied</li></ul>You use the checkbox at the bottom of the tab to make the H: devices
read only, as opposed to read/write. &nbsp;D: devices are also made read only using the same checkbox.<br><br>The
new D: patch has the advantage that it works in many programs that will
not support H:, but only recognize D: devices, such as Action!.
&nbsp;It is also fully compatible with MyDos, including the default
directory which can be accessed as D:. &nbsp;The patch is dynamic, and
reinstalls itself whenever the DOS overwrites it. &nbsp;It does require
a DOS, however, and will not work without a DOS as H: will.<br>

<br>

Starting in version 1.1, Atari800MacX supports all normal DOS functions
for the hard drives, including Rename, Delete, Note, Point, and Open
for
modify (read/write). &nbsp;One caveat is that all file names created
from
the Mac side should be lower case. &nbsp;<br>

<br>

Starting in version 1.2, Atari800MacX supports subdirectories on the
hard drives.<br>

<br>

Note, the Delete function will not work on Hard Drives from the Atari
DOS 2.x or MYDOS menus, as they do not recognize Hx: as a drive.
&nbsp;However, the XIO functions will work to delete.<br>

<br>

All file and Directory functions are supported by SpartaDos or BWDos
from
the command line, as well as from their XIO equivalents. &nbsp;Binary
Load
(with all options) will also work with MYDOS and its XIO equivelents.
&nbsp;<br>

<br>

Also, there is a capability to specify a Command Path for use with
SpartaDos
and BW-DOS when issuing command from the Hx: prompt. &nbsp;The normal
path
used with Dx: drives will not work, as this is part of the driver for
the
Dx: devices in the DOS. &nbsp;The paths specified here are separated by
semicolons,
and may include the normal directory seperator character ('&gt;'').
&nbsp;The
path defaults to "H1:&gt;DOS;&gt;DOS". &nbsp;This means that the "DOS"
directory
on Hard Drive 1 will be searched for the command, then the "DOS"
directory
on the current drive, then finally the current directory will be
searched.<br>
