Starting in Version 4.0,&nbsp;Atari800MacX allows the user to copy text
from the Atari to the Macintosh, and paste text from the Macintosh to
the Atari. &nbsp;Copy is only available when not in full screen, and
when the Mac mouse is not being used for Mouse emulation in the
emulator.<br><br><big style="text-decoration: underline;"><big>Pasting Text<br></big></big><br>To
paste text from the Macintosh to the Atari, simple use the standard
Cmd-V shortcut or Paste from the Menu. &nbsp;The pasted text is entered
into the emulator as keystrokes. &nbsp;This should allow paste to work
with any program that accepts keystroke input. &nbsp; The state of the
Atari capslock is stored at the start of the Paste process, and
restored after the Paste is complete. &nbsp;As the keys must be entered
at a normal typing pace, pasting a large buffer may take some time.
&nbsp;Should you wish to interrupt a Paste in process, simply hit any
key and the Paste will be terminated.<br><br><big style="text-decoration: underline;"><big>Copying Text<br></big></big><br>To
copy text from the Atari to the Macintosh, first it must be selected.
&nbsp;This can happen in two ways. &nbsp;First, you can use the
standard Select All shortcut Cmd-A or select Select All from the menu.
&nbsp;This will select the entire Atari screen, and you will see the
selection rectangle around the edge of the screen. &nbsp;The second
selection method is by clicking and dragging on the main Atari screen,
which will draw the selection rectangle. &nbsp;If you change your mind,
simply click or hit a key, and the selction will be cancelled.<br><br>Once
the text is selected, then you can use the standard Cmd-C shortcut or
Copy from the Menu. &nbsp;All graphics mode 0,1, or 2 text will be
copied to the paste buffer. &nbsp;If the selection area is more than
one line high, a line break will be inserted at the end of each line in
the selection rectangle.<br>
