The Display Tab is the heart of the graphics control of the
emulator.&nbsp; <br>




<img src="DisplayTab.jpg" title="" alt="" style="width: 752px; height: 515px;"><br>




<br>




From here you can change the:<br>




<br>




<b><u>Display Size</u><br>




</b><br>




&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp; Display Mode:</b>
<blockquote>These radio buttons allow you to choose to display the
emulator in a standard Aqua window, or to use the entire screen for
displaying the emulator. &nbsp;When in full screen mode, normally you
will want to check the Fullscreen Always 640x480 item.&nbsp; This will
lock the display to a fixed size.&nbsp; If this item is unchecked, then
the Scale Factor and Display Width parameters below still apply.&nbsp;
The emulator will attempt to find a suitable mode.&nbsp; Note, not all
modes will work with all display adapters.&nbsp; If the emulator
suddenly quits when changing to full screen, the Scale Factor and Scale
Mode were not compatible with your graphics card and fullscreen.&nbsp;
You can also change
the Display Mode setting from the <a href="DisplayMenu.html">Display
Menu.</a><br>




</blockquote>




&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp; Renderer:</b>
<blockquote>These radio buttons allow you to which renderer
Atari800MacX uses to display the screen.&nbsp; OpenGL requires a video
card that supports OpenGL, but will be much faster at scaling the
screen to larger sizes than the Software mode.&nbsp; However, OpenGL is
slower at the Smooth scaling than the Software renderer.&nbsp; OpenGL
is also more efficient in OSX 10.4 and high, where Apple has implemented
something called "coalesced updates".&nbsp; If you are having speed or
graphics problems on your particular machine, you may want to try the
other renderer from what you are currently using.&nbsp; The default
value in Atari800MacX 3.0 and higher is OpenGL.<br>




</blockquote>





&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Scale Factor:</b>
<blockquote>These radio buttons allow you to choose between the standard
Atari Screen Size where one Atari pixel is mapped to one Macintosh
pixel, 2xAtari Screen size (one Atari pixel is mapped to
four, 2x2,Macintosh pixels), 3x Atari Screen size (one Atari pixel is
mapped to nine, 3x3,Macintosh pixels),&nbsp; or 4x Atari Screen size
(one Atari pixel is mapped to sixteen, 4x4,Macintosh pixels).&nbsp;
&nbsp; You can also change this setting from
the <a href="DisplayMenu.html">Display Menu.</a> &nbsp;Note, on slower
Macs,
you may want to change your video depth to Thousands of Colors to
achieve
full frame rate when using more than 1x mode. &nbsp;(Don't change this
while
running the emulator!!!).<br>




</blockquote>




&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Display Width:</b>
<blockquote>These radio buttons allow you to choose between narrow,
default, and full widths of the Atari screen. &nbsp;These correspond to
320x240, 336x240, and 384x240 respectively when in 1x Scale Factor
mode.&nbsp; You can also change
this setting from the <a href="DisplayMenu.html">Display Menu.</a><br>




</blockquote>






&nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Use Fullscreen Monitor</span><b>:</b>
<blockquote>This check box allows you to select the Debug Monitor to
run in Fullscreen. Without this item checked, if the Debug Monitor runs
(by pressing F8), or the Emulated machine crashes, and the
unrecoverable error dialog runs, the emulator will leave Fullscreen and
display the monitor or crash dialog in a window. &nbsp;With this item
checked, the monitor will appear in fullscreen. &nbsp;You can also
select the foreground and background colors for the monitor text.
&nbsp;Note, you can currently only use the Fullscreen if you also
select the Fullscreen Always 640x480 Item.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="DisplayMenu.html"></a><br>




</blockquote>




<b><u>Show Frames Per Second In Window Title</u></b><br>




<b> </b>
<blockquote>This checkbox lets you choose to display the Frames Per
Second (FPS) that the emulator is running at the moment. &nbsp;This can
be used to check that your Macintosh is fast enough to run the Atari at
full speed. &nbsp;It should indicate 50fps for PAL, and 60fps for NTSC.
&nbsp;FPS Display is not available in Fullscreen mode. &nbsp;However,
since Fullscreen mode always runs in 256 colors, speed is usually not
an issue. &nbsp;You can also change this setting from the <a href="DisplayMenu.html">Display
Menu.</a><br>




  <br>




</blockquote>




<b><u>Brushed Metal Appearance</u></b><br>




<b> </b>
<blockquote>This checkbox lets you choose it the windows in the
emulator use the Standard Aqua appearance, or if they use the Brushed
Metal appearance, ala Safari or iTunes.&nbsp; The emulator must be
restarted after a change in this setting for it to take full effect.
&nbsp;Note, you must be using OSX 10.3 or higher to used the Brushed
Metal Appearance.<br>




</blockquote>




<b><u>TV Mode</u><br>




</b>
<blockquote>These radio buttons allow you to choose to the refresh rate
of the emulator, either NTSC (60 frames per second) or PAL (50 frames
per
second).<br>




</blockquote>




<br>




<b><u>Refresh Ratio</u><br>




</b>
<blockquote>This pull down allows you to choose how often to redraw the
simulated Atari screen. &nbsp;You can choose to do it every Atari frame,
or every
2nd, 3rd, or 4th one. &nbsp;On very slow Macs, this could be used to
bring
the frame rate up to full speed (50 or 60 frames per second).&nbsp; The
checkbox then lets you determine if player/missile collisions are
detected in the frames that are skipped.&nbsp; By default, they are.<br>




</blockquote>




<br>




<b><u>Artifacting Mode</u><br>




</b>
<blockquote>This pull down allows you to choose how the emulator
simulates Artifacting, which occurred when the original Atari used a TV
for displaying its video. &nbsp;Some games depended on the colors these
Artifacting effects produced.<br>




  <br>




</blockquote>




<b><u>Use New Artifacting</u><br>




</b>
<blockquote>This checkbox allows you to choose if the new Artifacting
method released in Atari800MacX 3.3 should be used.
&nbsp;It&nbsp;produces much clearer text, and correctly varies
luminance and displays player missile graphics in artifacted mode.<br>

  <br>




</blockquote>




<b><u>Color Palette</u><br>




</b>
<blockquote>These options allow the user to customize the colors used
by the
Macintosh to Emulate the Atari's color palette. 8-bit Atari machines
have
256 colors, and the emulator can either generate a palette, or use a
pre-generated
palette stored in a file. &nbsp;By default, it uses the real.act file
stored
in the Palettes folder in the application directory. &nbsp;<br>




  <br>




If the "Use Palette from File" checkbox is checked, then you can choose
the palette file with the Choose.. button. &nbsp;If you wish, you may
then
also check the "Adjust File Palette" checkbox to adjust the Black
Level,
White Level, and Intensity parameters described below. &nbsp;These
adjustments do not affect the file itself.<br>




  <br>




If the "Use Palette from File" checkbox is not checked, then the
emulator will generate a palette using the values you enter for the
following 4 parameters:<br>




</blockquote>




<blockquote>
  
  
  
  
  <ul>




    <li><b>Black level</b> adjusts brightness of Atari colors 0, 16,
32, etc. (darkest ones),</li>




    <li><b>White level</b> adjusts brightness of Atari colors 15, 31,
47, etc. (lightest ones),</li>




    <li><b>Intensity</b> adjusts saturation of all colors,</li>




    <li><b>Color shift</b> adjusts hues to be used for Atari colors
16-255 (0-15 are always gray). A hue is used for colors 16-31, next one
for colors 32-47, etc.</li>




  
  
  
  
  </ul>




</blockquote>




<blockquote>Each parameter must be an integer within range 0-255.<br>




</blockquote>




<b><u>Disk Leds<br>




<br>




</u></b>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">These options allow the user to chose
if disk activity indicators are shown in the Atari Emulator window
(lower right corner) and in the Media Status Window (Driver Status
LED's and sector numbers on drive doors).<br>
